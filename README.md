## 🎻 What is Viola ORM?

**Viola ORM** is a lightweight yet powerful Java Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that prioritizes **performance** and **type-safety**. By leveraging compile-time code generation, it eliminates the need for runtime reflection and provides an expressive, **Fluent API** for composing complex SQL queries in a completely object-oriented way.

This website is dedicated to providing you with all the information you need to get started with Viola ORM, from documentation and downloads to community support.

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description | Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compile-Time Code Generation** | Mapping code is generated during compilation, eliminating runtime reflection. | **Zero Reflection Overhead,** leading to significantly faster startup and execution times. |
| **Fluent API Query Builder** | A complete object-oriented interface for constructing SQL queries. | **Type Safety.** All queries are checked by the compiler, minimizing runtime SQL errors. |
| **Manual Entity Definition** | Allows developers to explicitly define tables and columns without using the annotation processor. | **Superior Flexibility** over other ORMs, enabling dynamic query building. |
| **Complex Primary Key Handling** | Supports composite keys by annotating multiple fields in an entity with `@Id`. | **Simplicity.** Handles complex mapping boilerplate automatically. |
| **Multi-Type Fetch Methods** | Flexible methods to retrieve query results as **Entity Objects**, **Maps**, or raw **Object arrays**. | **Versatility** to integrate with various data consumption requirements. |
